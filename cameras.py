"""This module implements simple cameras for the purpose of ray tracing.

In ray tracing, the color value of each pixel in the output image is computed
by locating the physical position of that pixel inside the camera within
3-dimensional space and retrace the origin of the beam by following its
trajectory in reverse. In a physical camera, the light collected by the
sensor passes through a narrow opening, the objective, which for simplicity
is modelled here as a dimensionless point. The pixels on the receptor, on the
other hand, form a rectangular grid, where each individual pixel has a small
but non-zero extension in space. When back-tracing a beam one needs to decide
from which point exactly to start within the surface area occupied by that
pixel. A common approach is to average over a collection of points drawn
randomly from across the entire area, which also helps improve continuity of
the resulting image.

        """Initializer of the Camera class.

        The parameters `image_height` and `image_width`, expressing the size
        of the output image in pixels, are both required. Since the aspect
        ratio of the film inside the camera should match that of the output
        image, only one of its lengths should be specified through
        `film_size`. This is taken by default as width, but it can be changed
        to height using `film_dir`, which can accept 'y', 'z', 'v', 'vertical',
        or 'height', ignoring case.

        The camera is positioned at the point `position` using the middle
        point of the film as anchor. The film is placed on the plane through
        position spanned by the first two columns of `orientation`. The latter
        are also rescaled to the size of a pixel and used as frame vectors
        for the pixel grid, pointing right and down, respectively.
        The objective is aligned with the camera position and placed along
        the *negative* direction of the third column of `orientation` at the
        distance specified by `focal_distance`.

        By default, the camera is placed so the film lies on the `xz`-plane,
        with its sides aligned with the axes and centered at the origin, while
        the objective is placed on the negative `y`-axis.

        **NOTE:** This initializer does *not* check that the given frame is
        non-degenerate, orthonormal, or positively oriented. This allows the
        user to experiment with distortion effects by using a skew frame.
        If the first two columns of `orientation` are linearly dependent,
        then the film degenerates to a slit or a point, and the output image
        becomes a collection of monochromatic lines. If the third column is
        in the span of the first two, then the objective will end up on the
        film and an error will occur when trying to shoot a ray.
